# Methodology

This brief is a reasoning-based analytic product. All sections were produced from 
first-principles analysis and operational reasoning, informed by anecdotal observation 
and pattern recognition. No active intrusion, hacking, or illegal behaviour was performed 
to produce this material.

**Approach:**
1. Decompose fraud into actors, processes, and incentives.  
2. Model human cognitive vulnerabilities exploited by scams.  
3. Reconstruct operational playbooks from procedural logic.  
4. Extract systemic patterns and failure points.  
5. Produce actionable insights and recommendations for private intelligence teams.

**Limitations:** This is an analytical exercise focused on structure and psychology 
rather than on technical Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) or forensic evidence.

# Intelligence Gaps

What I could not reliably find and why:

1. **Owner attribution** — WHOIS is privacy-protected, and there’s no public smoking-gun 
connecting a single named individual to all extraction activity. Privacy shielding 
obscures registrant details.

2. **Single extraction chain** — complaints show unique local handles; I could not 
connect them into a single financial chain from the central site to a single cashout 
endpoint. This supports the distributed-extraction hypothesis but leaves ownership 
ambiguous.

3. **Hosting churn & backups** — no deep forensic hosting artifacts were available from 
passive lookups. Hostinger is a shared platform and raw logs are not public.

4. **Cross-platform trail** — I did not investigate other platforms (ads, Telegram, 
Facebook groups) in this deliverable. That would likely reveal more lead-sellers or buyer 
networks, but is out of scope for this passive casefile.

These gaps are documented intentionally — they are part of why the analysis stays 
conservative and hypothesis-driven rather than accusatory.

# Infrastructure Analysis

This section summarises the passive technical footprint of **indiangigoloclub.com** and 
what it implies.

All records below are from passive lookups and the infra notes provided.

## Domain facts (key points)
- **Registration created:** 2015 (long lifespan)  
- **Registrant:** Privacy-protected via Domains By Proxy (DomainsByProxy, LLC)  
- **Hosting / IP:** Hostinger (AS47583) — IP 82.25.107.227 (geolocated to Mumbai)  
- **MX records:** mx1.hostinger.com / mx2.hostinger.com (standard Hostinger setup)  
- **Nameservers:** ns1.dns-parking.com / ns2.dns-parking.com (default parking DNS)  
- **Subdomains found:** autoconfig, autodiscover, mail (auto-generated defaults)

## What this footprint tells me (plain)
- The domain is not a short-lived fly-by-night address. It’s been alive for years. That 
suggests the site functions as a persistent lure rather than a one-off scam page.  
- Privacy-protected WHOIS is expected for adult/escort-style businesses, but it also 
makes attribution harder. That is an operational choice to hide ownership.  
- Hostinger hosting and default DNS indicate low-cost, template-based hosting. That does 
not prove criminality — but it shows the operator prioritised low friction and cheap 
maintenance over resilience or sophistication.  
- No CDN, no complex infrastructure, no advanced hosting signals. This is a simple web 
presence kept alive.

## Quick analyst reading
- **Minimal tech effort + long duration =** a deliberate low-tech lure maintained for 
long-term lead capture.  
- That pattern fits a centralised lead generation site feeding many downstream operators 
rather than a single integrated extraction operation.

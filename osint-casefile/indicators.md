# Indicators (operational, behavioral, non-technical)

These are the patterns I would flag or track when triaging similar domains or complaints.

## Payment & cashout
- Short, sequential payments to different UPI handles within a single victim timeline.  
- Unique UPI per complaint (suggesting local mule usage).

## Social engineering / language
- Reassuring language that suddenly escalates to urgency.  
- “Refund in cash” promise for meetups.  
- Claims of “security fee”, “activation fee”, “hotel booking fee”, “cancellation fee”.

## Documents & visuals
- Edited membership certificates, edited hotel confirmations, edited ID cards in 
screenshots.

## Infrastructure
- Long-lived domain with privacy-protection WHOIS.  
- Cheap/shared hosting (Hostinger ASN).

## Operational signals
- Discrepancy between central site and extraction handles (different phones/UPIs).  
- Rapid churn of extraction handles after cashout (disposable mules).

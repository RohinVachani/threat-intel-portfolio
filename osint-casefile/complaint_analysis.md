# Complaint Analysis

This section summarises the complaints and extracts repeating behavioural and operational 
patterns. The complaints dataset used here comes from a cluster of reports on 
consumercomplaints.in (selected representative complaints).

## What the complaints commonly show
- **Payment requests up-front** (registration fees, activation fees, "security" fees, 
hotel booking). Amounts vary widely from small (₹2,000) to large (₹52,000).  
- **Escalating payments in short sequence.** Victims often pay small amounts first, then 
are asked repeatedly for more in short intervals (tight time windows).  
- **Edited/fake documents presented as legitimacy proof.** Certificates, membership IDs, 
and hotel confirmations appear edited in screenshots.  
- **Common scripts and social tactics.** Phrases used: “this is the last payment,” 
“client will refund in cash,” “we need this for security/activation,” plus friendly-toned 
pressure.  
- **Ghosting after payment.** Many victims report being ignored after they pay and never 
getting the service or meeting promised.  
- **Different phone numbers and payment handles per complaint.** There is no single 
reusable UPI ID across many complaints in the sample — rather, each case shows unique or 
locally used payment handles.

## Behavioural indicators (from text / screenshots)
- Use of calm, reassuring language followed by pressure when resistance shows.  
- Reverse-psychology tactics (implying the victim might be dishonest) to confuse and 
regain control.  
- Offers of “refund in cash” at meetup as a tactic to justify prepayments.

## Patterns worth noting
1. **Lead capture → local extraction:** The domain appears to capture leads (people who 
sign up / pay) and then pass or expose those leads to local actors who do the cash 
extraction. This explains the different payment handles and phone numbers across 
complaints.  
2. **Scripted escalation:** The same escalation model repeats: small first fee → 
intermediary fee → booking/activation fee → emergency fee → cancellation fee. The 
amounts and labels change, but the sequence is consistent.  
3. **Edited proof as social proof:** Fake IDs / certificates / hotel screenshots are 
common. They are inconsistent and edited, but they create temporary trust.

# OSINT Casefile: indiangigoloclub.com

This casefile documents an ethical, open-source investigation into 
**indiangigoloclub.com**, a domain repeatedly cited in public complaint forums for fraud.  
All information was collected passively from open sources, user reports, and observable 
infrastructure.

The goal of this deliverable is to demonstrate:
- how I approach real-world OSINT  
- how I structure incomplete information  
- how I extract behavioral and operational patterns from scattered signals  
- how I build adversary models from first principles  
- how I reason about ecosystems, not just data points

### Why I picked this domain
I picked this domain because it had an unusually high cluster of complaints (342+), many 
explicitly using words like *scam* and *fraud*. That concentration is what made this 
domain interesting and worth a focused, passive investigation.

### Files in this Casefile
- `methodology.md` — how the investigation was conducted  
- `infrastructure.md` — domain, hosting, DNS, MX, ASN, footprint  
- `complaint_analysis.md` — patterns extracted from public complaints  
- `operational_assessment.md` — reconstruction of scam workflow and structure  
- `indicators.md` — behavioural, linguistic, and operational indicators  
- `intelligence_gaps.md` — what couldn’t be found and why  
- `conclusion.md` — final assessment  
- `complete_osint_report.md` — combined full report  
- `assets/` — optional images or diagrams

### Analyst note
This casefile is reasoning-driven and focuses on adversary psychology, infrastructure 
patterning, and operational reconstruction rather than heavy tool usage.  
It represents how I think, how I investigate, and how I model criminal operations using 
publicly available signals.

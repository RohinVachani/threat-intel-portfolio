# Operational Assessment

This is my reconstruction of how the operation likely works, based on infrastructure and 
complaint patterns.

## Core hypothesis (short)
- **Centralised lead-generation (the website) → distributed extraction (many local 
operators).**  
  The website’s role: attract, present legitimacy, and create initial trust. Local 
operators (or “buyers” of leads) complete the extraction using local mules and phone 
numbers.

## How it likely runs (step-by-step)
1. **Lure & sign-up:** Victim sees the site or ad, signs up or contacts via WhatsApp.  
2. **Initial payment:** Small registration/activation fee is requested. This verifies 
victim willingness to pay.  
3. **Escalation:** Scammer asks for multiple sequential payments — hotel, taxi, security, 
activation, cancellation — each justified differently.  
4. **Local handoff:** Once the victim is hooked, the lead is either forwarded to a local 
operator or the payment is routed to a local mule account (city-based actor).  
5. **Cashout:** Local operator/mule withdraws cash or moves funds through local channels.  
6. **Ghosting & abandonment:** After cashout, communication stops. Victim reports the 
fraud; the domain remains untouched and ready for the next cycle.

## Why this model makes sense
- It explains the **lack of repeated UPI reuse** across complaints: extraction is done by 
independent local actors.  
- It increases resilience: takedown of one mule or local operator doesn’t incapacitate 
the whole network.  
- It keeps the central site simple — low maintenance, long lifespan — while outsourcing 
the riskier cash operations to disposable local actors.

## Risk/Threat score (analyst judgement)
- **Threat score:** Medium-High.  
  Rationale: repeated complaints, long-lived domain, consistent scripts, and clear 
financial impact on victims point to an established fraudulent model. While there’s no 
single smoking-gun technical indicator tying ownership to all extraction, the operational 
signals are strong.

## Evidence weight
- Infrastructure signals: **Low-to-Medium** (privacy + cheap hosting + long lifespan).  
- Complaint pattern signals: **Medium-High** (consistent social-engineering patterns, 
edited documents, sequential payments).

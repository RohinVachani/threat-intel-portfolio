# Methodology

This investigation was performed entirely through **passive OSINT**, using only publicly 
accessible information from:
- WHOIS records  
- DNS, MX, and ASN lookups  
- Consumer complaint forums  
- Screenshots shared by victims  
- Basic metadata analysis  
- Cross-case behavioral comparison

No intrusive actions, scanning, probing, or unauthorized access were used.

My approach was simple:

1. **Observe the raw signals**  
   Domain data, registration patterns, phone numbers, UPI handles, screenshots.

2. **Find recurring shapes**  
   Complaints follow themes even when the exact details differ.

3. **Separate noise from meaningful signals**  
   Not every UPI ID matters, but the lack of reuse matters.  
   Not every phone number matters, but the burner-number pattern matters.

4. **Reconstruct the workflow**  
   How victims were approached, how money flowed, how urgency was manufactured.

5. **Model the underlying structure**  
   When direct technical indicators are limited, behavior exposes the architecture.

### Scope decisions and why I limited sources
I focused on **consumercomplaints.in** because it had the largest, most relevant cluster 
of reports for this domain. The goal here is to show I can extract intelligence from 
available public reports — not to run an exhaustive multi-platform hunt. That’s a 
deliberate trade-off: depth of pattern extraction from one rich source rather than 
breadth across noisy platforms.

### Site visits
I have visited the website visually (no interactions, no clicks that would constitute 
active probing). Visual cues were noted but not treated as proof. The analysis relies on 
patterns in public reports and infrastructure data.
